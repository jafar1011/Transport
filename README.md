# Project (Finished)

Hi, this is the flowchart of the tables at the moment. <br> I have added the tables to local sql server (My individual accounts by default is sqlserver not sqlite(this has been changed to sqlite)). <br>


## WorkFlow Walkthrough
- Driver & Student:
- Driver registers -> Verification request sent to admin -> Verified ->  Driver adds post.
- Student registers -> Browses posts -> Contacts Driver -> Driver sends invite to student by his phone number.
- Student accepts invite -> Student is now linked to the drivers as passenger.
- Parent & Student:
- Parent registers -> Parent sends invite to student by his phone number.
- Student accepts invite -> Student is now linked to the parent.
